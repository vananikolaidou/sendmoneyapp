## 🚀 How to Run the App

Please ensure you have the React Native development environment set up.

To run the app on an Android device or emulator, use the following command:

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

To execute the test suite:

## ⏳ Limitations
Due to time constraints, unit tests for the Login and Register screens were not implemented, and a loading indicator is missing during the registration process. These would be addressed in future improvements.
